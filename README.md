# stock-scraper

This code is designed to scrape Yahoo Finance for stock ticker symbols along with their full name, how much the stock has changed in a day, and the profit or loss that the investor has seen since the initial invenstment.

The code relies on JSoup to scrape Yahoo Finance. The version I used was version 1.10.3 which can be found here: https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/releases

The code also uses my custom tools for Regular Expressions and the Swing GUI. The source code can be found in my repositories: https://github.com/BrianMichell?tab=repositories or directly: https://github.com/BrianMichell/Utilities

This version is currently under development and is not working as expected.
